Arm strong number

arm stron number is  nothing but number of n digits should be equal to sum of nth power of its digits.

example of arm strong number.

153 => length of 153 is '3'  so  n=3;
now 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3
=> 3 + 125+ 27
=> Total = 153

Hence 153 is a arm strong number

for i in range(1001):
    num = i
    result = 0 
    n = len(str(i)) #As we cant find out thee length of a number  so here we are converting the number in the form of string by using the perticular code.
    
    while(i != 0):
        digit = i%10
        result = result + digit**n 
        i = i//10
        if(result == num):
            print(num, "is a ArmStrong number")

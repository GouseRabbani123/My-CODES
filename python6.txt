#HCF of 2 numbers
Logic of HCF: HIGHEST COMMON FACTOR
example :=> number1 = 25
            number2 = 15
factors of 25 = 5*5
factors of 15 = 5*3
common factors  of the both numbers is 5.
soo 5 is the hcf of the bothe the numbers

EXAMPLE2 => number1 = 36
            number2 = 20
            factors of 36 = 2*2*3*3
            factors of 20 = 2*2*5
            the common factors are 2*2 = 4


SIMPLE MEATHOD TO FIND THE HCF

ex: numbers are 25 and 15
divide 25 by 15, remainder is 10
divide 15 by 10, remainder is 5
divide 10 by 5, remainder is 0

soo the hcf of 25 and 15  is 5



ex-2: numbers are 36 and 20
divide 36 by 20 remainder is 16
divide 20 by 16 remaindeer is 4
divide 16 by 4 remainder is 0 

soo the hcf of 36 and 20 is 4
